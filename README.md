# BakeryGallery

-I have designed this gallery page for my practice. The gallery page theme is inspired by modern aesthetic bakery.
-I designed this using Html,CSS and Javascript.
  -The basic functionalities are :
* -card images can be hovered over and even viewed individually by clicking . I did this using javascript elements and sadding suited styles in css.
* - Gallery will flow in motion from left to right then start again using keyframes for flow animation
* - A functional navbar with a search bar which can be further designed and home,contact page linked to the navbar as well.
- Prerequisites:
- 1. The images are in webp format so to load them faster hence all files with webp format are the images.
-- - Now you can Freely fork or clone this site page and use it as per purposes.---
